Title: "Project Week 1"
Author: Amanda
=============================================

This assignment will be described in multiple parts, with answers to the questions detailed.

1) Dataset: Activity monitoring data [52K]
- CSV file
2) Variables included : 
- steps: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded as NA)
- date: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format
- interval: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken

=============================================

Notes:
- Needed: dplyr, tidyr, knitr, ggplot2 and lubridate package
- Dataset available at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip

# 1) Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r}
## Load needed packages
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(knitr)
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
## Set Directory
setwd("C:/Users/amand/Desktop/IBM/JH - data science/reproducible")

## Download File
url <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip"
download.file(url, destfile = "Factivity.zip")

## Untar the file
untar("Factivity.zip")

## list.files() to find the name of the files
list.files()
```

```{r, echo = TRUE }
## Read CSV and create data frame
df <- read.csv(file = "activity.csv", header = T, na.strings = "NA")

## Preview the dataframe
str(df)
```

```{r, echo = TRUE }
## Date vairable is a "character" in Y-M-D, convert to "date"

df$date <- parse_date_time(df$date, orders = "Ymd")

# Check transformation

str(df)
```

# 2) What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
Ignore the missing values in the dataset.

1. Calculate the total number of steps taken per day

2. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

3. Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day

```{r, echo = TRUE }
## 2.1 Total number of steps taken per day

sum(df$steps, na.rm = TRUE) #ignore NA
```

```{r, echo = TRUE }
## 2.2 Histogram of the total number of steps taken per day
# Group DF by date and creat a total steps column
total_steps <- df %>%
                group_by(date) %>%
                    summarise(totalsteps = sum(steps))
# Check table
head(total_steps)
```

```{r, echo = TRUE }
# Plot the histogram

ggplot(total_steps, aes(x = totalsteps)) +
     geom_histogram(binwidth = 1000) +
     ggtitle("Total Number Of Steps Taken Per Day") +
     labs(y = "Count",
          x = "Total Steps Per Day")
```

```{r, echo = TRUE }
## 2.3 Mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day

mean(total_steps$totalsteps, na.rm = TRUE) #ignore NA
median(total_steps$totalsteps, na.rm = TRUE)
```

# 3) What is the average daily activity pattern?

1) Make a time series plot of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

2) Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

```{r, echo = TRUE }
## 3.1 Time Series Plot: 5min interval x AVG steps by day

# Group DF by date and interval; create an *average steps* column
avg_steps <- df %>%
                group_by(date, interval) %>%
                    summarise(average_steps = mean(steps, na.rm = FALSE))
# Check table
head(avg_steps)
```

```{r, echo = TRUE }
# Plot the Time Series Plot

ggplot(avg_steps, aes(x = avg_steps$interval, y = average_steps)) +
  geom_line() +
  ggtitle("Average Number Of Steps Taken Per Interval") +
  labs(y = "Average Steps by day",
       x = "5min interval")
```

```{r, echo = TRUE }
# 3.2 Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

head(arrange(avg_steps, desc(average_steps)), n = 1)
```

# 4) Imputing missing values

1. Calculate total number of rows with NAs in the dataset.

2. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset.

3. Create a new dataset with the missing data filled in.

4. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

5. Calculate a the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. 
- Do these values differ from the first estimates? 
- What is the impact of imputing this missing data?

```{r, echo = TRUE }
## 4.1 Total number of rows with NAs
summary(df)

# 2304 NA's on the STEPS variable
```

```{r, echo = TRUE }
## 4.2 Fill the NAs
# NA replaced by the value 0, to mean 0 steps taken in that interval
## 4.3 New DataSet with the NAs as 0

new_df <- df
new_df$steps <- new_df$steps %>% replace_na(0)

## 4.4 Histogram
# Group DF by date and create a total steps column
new_total_steps <- new_df %>%
                    group_by(date) %>%
                        summarise(totalsteps = sum(steps))
# Check table
head(new_total_steps)
```

```{r, echo = TRUE }
# 4.4 Plot the histogram

ggplot(new_total_steps, aes(x = totalsteps)) +
     geom_histogram() +
     ggtitle("Total Number Of Steps Taken Per Day") +
     labs(y = "Count",
          x = "Total Steps Per Day")
```

```{r, echo = TRUE }
## 4.5 Mean and median of the NEW total number of steps taken per day

mean(new_total_steps$totalsteps)
median(new_total_steps$totalsteps)

## Do these values differ from the first estimates?
# Yes, they�re both smaller than the original mean and median
## What is the impact of imputing this missing data?
# It changes the first estimated value; ignoring NA�s may affect results.
```

# 5) Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

Use the dataset with the filled-in missing values for this part.

1) Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels � �weekday� and �weekend� 

2) Make a panel plot containing a time series plot of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). 

```{r, echo = TRUE }
## 5.1 New factor variable with two levels � �weekday� and �weekend"
# wday = dates to weekday; 1 = sunday, 2 = monday, ..., 7 = saturday

new_df2 <- df
new_df2$steps <- new_df2$steps %>% replace_na(0) # replacing the NAs for 0 
new_df2$weekdays <- factor(wday(new_df2$date))   # placing the weekdays numbers
```

```{r, echo = TRUE }
# 5.2 Plot the Time Series Plot

ggplot(new_df2, aes(x = interval, y = steps)) +
geom_histogram((aes(group = weekdays, color = weekdays)), stat = "summary", fun = "mean") +
  ggtitle("Average Number Of Steps Taken Per Interval") +
  labs(y = "Average Steps by interval",
       x = "Interval")
```
